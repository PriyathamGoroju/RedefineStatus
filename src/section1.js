        The fact that our designer goods do not represent wealth for positive utility is having more negative damage to society than we can fathom. This article is going to help detail why, and detail our solution in progress.

        As individuals, once we cover our basic needs, status becomes an intrinsic motivator in the rest of our actions. Status comes in many forms. The healthiest / most enlightened cultures put the highest status in rewarding positive sum behavior. In global culture, luxury goods like a Gucci bag/belt have become widespread as top status symbols, reflecting vapid use of money as the highest form of status. It has become such common Christmas list item for broke young teenagers that the richest man on the planet at the time of this writing got his riches from selling these overpriced goods representing nothing more than the ability to waste money. Collectively this misrepresentation of true status (service to others) is attributing more damage to building a healthy positive culture than we can imagine.

      Social media, our emergent global cultural production system, could be used collectively to unify humanity around bettering ourselves and others. Instead it is used to further extract youth through a false form of status as a service. Imagine a world where this wasteful spending was considered cancelable. One where we collectively take accountability for the capability to money to the positive growth of us as a species. Imagine a world where the designer things we wore showed off spending a lot of money to make a lot of positive impact. If the world you imagined only went as far as to redistribute the wealth of designer wear, try imagining the deeper cultural effects this new alignment would have.
